HEX
===

Tiny hex viewer.

Currently without any real functions and mostly a prototype, I hope to be able
to keep up the work and transform it into the data explorer I always wanted.

The name is a working title. I suck at naming (much like many other devs) and
will attend to this task later. Suggestions welcome. :)
